# release-tracking-app

Spring boot application for tracking release details - status changes, date of release, when was the release created and last updated.

Application is packed inside docker image and can be run by starting the image from DockerHub repository: 
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bogdanzdr/release-tracking-dockerhub/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated 


Application supports basic CRUD operations:
- GET /releases
- GET /relsease/{id}
- POST /releases
- PUT /releases/{id}
- DELETE /releases/{id}

Swagger specification for the endpoints can be checked by:
 - starting the application and openingn Swagger UI on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
 - or by checking swagger-doc-api.yaml in the project directory
 
 
 A simple React application was created for the UI part that runs on http://localhost:8080/
